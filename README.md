# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

//Requirements 
1. Create a React application.
2. Fetch all the pokemons as a 4 in a column 5 row with pagenation allowed. From the Following api https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon (reference: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#named) fetching initially 20.
3.  Fetching individual data from which available in the url of pokemon list endpoint (reference: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon-section) and show images of it from sprites images front_default.
4. If we click on it we have to go to that pokemon data in which we have to show all images of it available in it and like height weight, fetch abilities and display them. 
5. All this data has to stored in the context. we shouldn't go to refetch those details again once they visit the same page. (Hint: useReducer and useContext together will be best) make it as a global or shared or separate component.
6. Routes has to go contain name. If we refresh in that page should need to fetch the details from the route and display the details.

//Steps to execute: There are simple steps need to be followed to execute the application
--> Download zip folder and Unzip the folder (or) Extract all the files
--> After setting up the path run the following commands in the command prompt to install necessary libraries and setup the environment:
    npm install (or) npm i
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm start
--> Then click y(Yes) to display the user interface
